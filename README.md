## Introduction

**ABC** is a mobile application created with Flutter to help children learn the Finnish alphabet and words. The app is designed for use at home, in early childhood education, and the first years of primary school. With these use cases in mind, ABC is built to be easy and quick to use. The application contains no ads.

The project utilizes the [Nykysuomen sanalista](https://www.kotus.fi/aineistot/sana-aineistot/nykysuomen_sanalista) from Kotus as its primary data source. The dataset has been carefully filtered and approved by a a professional in early childhood education to ensure it's safe and appropriate for children.

The dataset used in the app can be found in [`assets/data/words_children`](./assets/data/words_children).

The *full* dataset is also included in this repository, although it's not included as an asset in the `pubspec.yaml`: [`assets/data/words`](./assets/data/words). 

## TODO

The application is still under construction. Here are some ideas that may be included in the first release of this application: 
- Add pictures for words (via AI?)
- Add next/previous letter indicators (and a dragging animation?)
- Implement word categories

If you have ideas of your own to be implemented in the app, create an [issue](https://github.com/paatre/abc/issues/new) or a [pull request](https://github.com/paatre/abc/compare), and I'll take a look at it.
