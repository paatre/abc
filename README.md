# abc

ABC is a Flutter application for my children to learn Finnish alphabet and words. The application is meant to be as simple as possible so that it doesn't contain any views a child could do something wrong in.

The project uses Nykysuomen sanalista from Kotus as its primary data at this point of time: https://www.kotus.fi/aineistot/sana-aineistot/nykysuomen_sanalista. Here's Google Sheet with the CSV uploaded: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19F00FIiT1p11etQ-X_rC3Mk7B8mhjhqtljh26GaNVxE/edit?usp=sharing.

## TODO

- Fix horizontal layout
- Sensor some words for children
- Include only a handful of words for each letter?
- Add pictures for words (via AI?)
- Implement word categories
- Add next/previous letter indicators (and a dragging animation?)
- Write tests
